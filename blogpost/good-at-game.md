# You might be good at one game

But, what else you're good at?

**The love hate relationship with gaming...**

You spent days and nights, several days completely sleep 
deprived to grind on the games, straight for weeks, for months. You did it!
You attained the top of the playable contents and achieved max score on everything with your META (Most effective tactics available). 
But now what? Imagine the game closed down. Imagine your friends that still cares about the game no longer does, what will be the purpose of all those astronomical time you spent on it?

Wasted.

We loved playing games, and playing games

That is, don't just play a game, do what the game inspired you to do instead. Did it taught you traffic management and civil engineering? Go for it. Did it inspired you to be a real DJ? Be a real DJ. The game visual make you wonder how everything is modeled and rendered? Go study graphics programming and modeling! None? Leave the game then.

You might be extremely good at one game, *but so long as the game lasts*. Your spent time is spent forever, choose what to spend those on :)
